# Decision-Tree
### Summary of the Project
The project consists in implementing an algorithm for the construction of a static decision tree. The tree is split based on the calculation of the gini score and gain. The tree is evaluated using Precision, Recall and F1-Score. The tree works for binary, categorical or continuous feature types. 
### File Overview
**main.py** This is the main script of the lab, that runs the necessary computations to produce the results expected for each question. The syntax to
run it as an executable is python main.py. 

**PointSet.py** This file defines a class meant to handle a set of points and how
to split them at best to build a decision Tree. 

**Tree.py** This file defines a class meant to represent a decision tree.
